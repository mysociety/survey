# PostgreSQL tables have extra columns (e.g. xmax) which potentially reveal
# information about the order rows were inserted. This could be a privacy
# violation if somebody also had access to the main fyr database, and carefully
# compared the order of arrival of surveys on a particular day.
#
# This simple script rebuilds the table anew with the rows in a random order.
